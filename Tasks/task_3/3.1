--What are the longest and shortest run times among the movies?

--With the help of function MAX and MIN, runtimes can be calculated.

-- Longest runtime
SELECT MAX(runtime) AS longest_runtime 
FROM deduplicated_list 
WHERE type = 'MOVIE';

-- Shortest runtime
SELECT MIN(runtime) AS shortest_runtime 
FROM deduplicated_list 
WHERE type = 'MOVIE';
