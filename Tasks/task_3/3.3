--What are the 10 longest titles? What are the 10 shortest titles? How long are they?

-- Longest titles
SELECT 
    title, 
    LENGTH(title) AS title_length
FROM deduplicated_list
ORDER BY title_length DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Shortest titles
SELECT 
    title, 
    LENGTH(title) AS title_length
FROM deduplicated_list
ORDER BY title_length ASC
LIMIT 10;

--here the LENGTH() function returns the length of a string and using LIMIT we can display top 10 list
